{# this is an example of how the pages will be created
You will no longer need to add the nav bar and body tags since this page will inherit all from the master.html file.
All you need to do now is to go ahead and add your content for the page
#}

{% extends "layout/master.html" %}


{% block content %}


    <!-- Page Content -->
    <div class="container">

        <!-- place your page contents here -->

    </div>
    <!-- /.container -->

{% endblock %}
